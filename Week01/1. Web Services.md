# Web Services

## Historical background

Traditional web applications (ASP, PHP, ASP.NET WebForms/MVC, Ruby on Rails etc.) are usually applications where everything is rendered server-side, and the client (i.e. the web browser) receives an HTML document. This architecture has a number of pros:

* the client can be "lightweight", i.e. it only has to render the HTML
* if the application has to be modified, it can be done in a single place, i.e. on the server

However, there are also cons:

* this may result in a lot of overhead being passed between client and server, i.e. a small change in a page may result in a full page reload
* if the client isn't a web browser, it will have to parse the result and extract exactly the data it needs to display, which is fragile and error-prone.

In recent years, a different architecture has become increasingly popular: the server doesn't render a full HTML page, but only delivers the data. The client must then take care of rendering the data, usually as HTML, but other clients (i.e. iOS/Android apps) can use different rendering methods.

In general, having an API is the most important decision you can make. How it is implemented is less important.

The number of APIs which are publicly available keeps growing, as well as [pages which list official APIs](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2dq2im/a_page_listing_apis_in_iceland_are_there_similar/).

## Types of web services

There are a number of different types of web services which have been developed over the course of years:

* SOAP
* REST
* WCF

Recently, REST services are becoming more and more popular. We will spend most time looking at how to implement a RESTful web service using ASP.NET Web API.
